## About

This project offers 155 most popular TV shows over the last 30 years with the highest rating on IMDb and calculates for users how much time they have spent watching these shows.

Project was made by junior software engineer Iryna Trush in order to increase awareness about how much time the person has been spending watching TV shows.

## How it works:

By default when a user clicks on a show, the program counts the total time to watch this TV show completely( includes all episodes and all seasons). If a user doesn't recognise the show in a list, they can click on the IMDb icon on a poster and find out more.

After the user has selected the TV show, they can edit data. For example, how many times they watched TV show completely, or change the number of seasons from TV shows they have seen;

Total time is always on the screen. It updates every time the user adds or removes a show or makes changes to it. If the user wants to start over there is a reset icon for it.

Days are shown in 24 hours format. Total time can differ by 10%;

To calculate the result program uses the number of seasons, how many episodes every season has and average duration of one episode. If the TV show is still running, the program calculates the number of episodes that have been shown as on January 23, 2023;

## Next steps

Implement the search and implement inspiring content for users about their time and what they can do with it;

## How to develop

To run the development environment you can use the npm start command.
To build the production version you can run npm run build command

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
